# DilemmaGame
JavaScript logic game

Game Description and Rules:

The user must attempt to locate a "madman" who is hidden among the set number of squares, which represent a group of people. The user may click on any desired square and as a result bomb it to find the madman; however, they must be mindful that with each additional click, they will be killing many innocents in search of the madman. The game terminates once the user has found the madman, or if the madman has no further hiding places.

Movements:

The user may click on any desired square except those which have already been bombed.

After every three failed attempts,the madman lights three additional fires of his own in a random position, and changes his position.

The madman is able to move to any location except that which is directly above, under, to the left of or to the right of any lit fire (bombs light fires)

The user must make the decision whether to keep bombing more groups of people to find the madman or to give up. If they choose to give up, they must click the "I give up" button on the side, indicating the madman's victory.

Good Luck!
